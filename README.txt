## Concept
Stop passive is a short python script that plays a song when you don't use your keyboard for <firstarg> amount of time (seconds) and checks/play the song after <secondarg> amount of time
It's an evil but efficient way to force yourself to be productive

## Example
    python stop_passive.py 60 10 #will play a sound every 10 seconds after 60 seconds of keyboard inactivity
